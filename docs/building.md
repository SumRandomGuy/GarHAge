### Building GarHAge

1. Attach your NodeMCU to the middle of the mini solderless breadboard, leaving one female port next to each NodeMCU port.
2. Mount the mini solderless breadboard in your project box.
3. Mount the dual-relay module in your project box.
4. Plug a jumper wire from VCC on the relay module to VIN / VU on the NodeMCU.
5. Plug a jumper wire from GND on the relay module to GND on the NodeMCU.
6. Plug a jumper wire from CH1 on the relay module to D2 on the NodeMCU (or Arduino/ESP8266 GPIO4).
7. Plug a jumper wire from CH2 on the relay module to D1 on the NodeMCU (or Arduino/ESP8266 GPIO5).

_Done!_
