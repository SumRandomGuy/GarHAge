6. Connect bell/low voltage wire to the NO and COMMON terminals of relay 1 on your relay module; run the wire to the garage door opener for Door 1 and connect to the opener's terminals (the same terminals that the pushbutton switch for your door is attached to).
7. Connect bell/low voltage wire to the NO and COMMON terminals of relay 2 on your relay module; run the wire to the garage door opener for Door 2 and connect to the opener's terminals (the same terminals that the pushbutton switch for your door is attached to).
